{: .no_toc .header }

----

Sometimes, we want to remotely monitoring Windows servers using WMI, we can do this by using **Windows WMI Monitoring** plugin.



## Creating Windows WMI Monitoring

To start monitor a Windows server, you first need to make sure you have installed a Windows collector, if not please follow instructions to  [add a Windows collector](../../10_infrastructures/windows/) first.

Once you have the Windows collector, you can follow steps in  [Add Monitor Service](../service/) by selecting **Windows (WMI)** monitoring plugin:

*Note: Make sure to select a **Windows** collector in the collector selection page*

You'll need to create provide the Windows host / domain information along with the username and password to complete adding the service:

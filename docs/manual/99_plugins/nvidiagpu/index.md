# Nvidia GPU Monitoring
{: .no_toc .header }

Nvidia GPU Monitoring utilizes the nvidia-smi command installed on the local machine to monitor various parameters of the graphics card, such as power consumption, temperature, fan speed, and more.

As AI continues to advance, particularly with the increasing prevalence of localized language models like LLMs, the demand for GPU monitoring is on the rise. Monitoring GPU usage goes beyond simply tracking utilization; it involves keeping tabs on fan speeds, temperatures, and other factors to prevent GPU wear and tear.

In addition to usage metrics, we've observed instances of GPUs inexplicably going offline during heavy usage. Despite programs running smoothly, sudden drops in GPU utilization raise concerns. This underscores the importance of continuous monitoring to identify and address such issues promptly.

Effective GPU utilization relies on understanding usage patterns through long-term monitoring. Only by analyzing our usage habits over time can we ensure efficient and reliable GPU performance.

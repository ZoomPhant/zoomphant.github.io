7. There are two params in this step. 
   1. rpcUrl: The RPC URL specifies the blockchain address you want to monitor. For example, if you want to monitor the Polygon network, you should fill in the RPC URL as follows: https://polygon-rpc.com. 
   2. sample: The sample parameter specifies how many transaction data points you want to collect for calculating gas prices and other metrics. Due to limitations imposed by public blockchain networks, you cannot set this value too high. However, if you are monitoring your local private chain, you can set a larger value to ensure accurate data retrieval.

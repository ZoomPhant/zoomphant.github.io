In such deployments all ZoomPhant functions will be available in customer data center, this allow customers to own their data and reduce unnecessary bandwidth.

For paid customers, they can register to ZoomPhant Cloud for advanced functions like system upgrading, SMS/Voice notifications, plugin managements etc.

## Using Cloud Service

ZoomPhant will also offer traditional SaaS cloud service.  Users can just register and start using ZoomPhant service by just installing data collecting agents.
